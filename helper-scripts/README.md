# Sample scripts

These helper scripts (combined) when placed one folder above the checkout folder, allow you to easily run this
code with eg. a cronjob.

These scripts assume a local rippled (xrpld) instalce is running a websocket server on 127.0.0.1:8080, and
the repository checked out to `/root/supply-calculator`. These scripts should then reside in `/root/`, and
the process can be started with `/root/run.sh`.
